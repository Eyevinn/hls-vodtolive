Node library for the conversion of HLS VOD to HLS Live (A continuation and rebranding of vod-to-live.js library that is now deprecated)

## Installation

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-vodtolive
```

## Usage

This library load and parses HLS VOD manifests and generates HLS Live manifests. The example below loads one HLS VOD and then another HLS VOD that is appended to the first one. The `getLiveMediaSequences(mediaseq)` returns HLS Live media sequence slices, and in the example below outputs the last live media sequence representation of the first VOD.

```
const HLSVod = require('@eyevinn/hls-vodtolive');
const vod = new HLSVod('https://example.com/vod.m3u8');
const vod2 = new HLSVod('https://example.com/vod2.m3u8');
vod.load().then(() => {
    // Get media sequence no 5 for bitrate 798000
    console.log(vod.getLiveMediaSequences(0, '798000', 5));
    return vod2.loadAfter(vod);
}).then(() => {
    console.log(vod.getLiveMediaSequences(vod.getLiveMediaSequencesCount(), '798000', 0));
}).catch(console.error);
```

One use case for this library is to simulate a linear live HLS stream by concatenating HLS VODs together which live HLS manifests are generated from. The open source library [Channel Engine](https://github.com/Eyevinn/channel-engine) provides an example of this.

What this library does can be illustrated by this simplified example below:

```
#EXTINF:9
seg1.ts
#EXTINF:9
seg2.ts
#EXTINF:9
seg3.ts
#EXTINF:4
seg4.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

is made available as:

```
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:9
seg1.ts
#EXTINF:9
seg2.ts
#EXTINF:9
seg3.ts
```

```
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:2
#EXTINF:9
seg2.ts
#EXTINF:9
seg3.ts
#EXTINF:4
seg4.ts
```

Another on-demand HLS can be concatenated

```
#EXTINF:9
segB1.ts
#EXTINF:9
segB2.ts
#EXTINF:9
segB3.ts
#EXTINF:4
segB4.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```
to yield the following media sequences

```
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:3
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:9
seg3.ts
#EXTINF:4
seg4.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:9
segB1.ts
```

```
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:4
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:4
seg4.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:9
segB1.ts
#EXTINF:9
segB2.ts
```

```
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:5
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE:0
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:9
segB1.ts
#EXTINF:9
segB2.ts
#EXTINF:9
segB3.ts
```


To use this library with subtitles the following options are required to be supplied when creating a new instance of HLSVod
 ```
shouldContainSubtitles: true, // says that the loaded VOD should contain subtitles and to create dummy if missing.
expectedSubtitleTracks: subtitleTracks, // says that the loaded VOD should contain subtitles and to create dummy if missing
dummySubtitleEndpoint: "/dummysubs.vtt", // it should link to an endpoint that will serve empty vtt files.
subtitleSliceEndpoint: "/subtitlevtt.vtt", // it should link to an endpoint that can splice and vtt file and serve it in case a VOD contains
    subtitle segments longer than video segments.
```
